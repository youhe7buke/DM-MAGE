# DM-MAGE Project

## Introduction

This project represents Chi's master's thesis work, supervised by Haoj.

**Please note:** Due to their large size, the model checkpoint files are not included in this repository.

## Reproduction Guide

To reproduce the work presented in the associated paper/thesis, please follow these steps:

1.  **Configure CUDA Environment:**
    Ensure that your system has the NVIDIA drivers and the corresponding CUDA toolkit installed correctly. This project relies on GPU acceleration for execution.

2.  **Modify File Paths:**
    The code may contain hardcoded absolute file paths (e.g., for data loading, model saving, etc.). Please review the code and update these paths to reflect the actual locations on your system.

    *(Optional: You can specify here which configuration files or scripts require path modification)*

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *(You can add instructions here for installing necessary Python packages or other dependencies, e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*
